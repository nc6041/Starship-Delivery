# Starship-Delivery
CS400 group project implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm

Project Title: Starship Delivery
Brief Project Description:
Our project will be a program used to optimize starship delivery routes. We will have a map of dorms and dining halls, with different distances (“weights”) to each location. The person using this app is the person controlling the starships, so they can have the authority to remove locations and determine which path the robot will take to get to the client.
Representative Tasks Performed Using this Application:
1. Find’s shortest path from restaurant to dorm
2. Allows the user to input a starting point and destination
3. Allows the user to remove a location if it’s not viable anymore

Data Wrangler: Natalie Cheng
Brief description of the Data Wrangler’s role and responsibilities in this project:
Data Wrangler will load the map of distances from the respective nodes (dining hall to dorm building, with other UW Madison buildings as nodes here and there as well) 

Application Data: 
Locations of UW residence halls and dining halls as well as their distances from each other

Development Responsibilities and Deadlines:
StarshipInfo.csv  - creating the Nodes and their distances with
StarshipLoader.java  - load csv file and organize information
